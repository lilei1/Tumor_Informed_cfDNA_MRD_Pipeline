# Tumor-Informed cfDNA MRD Pipeline

A comprehensive pipeline for detecting Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) in colorectal cancer patients using tumor-informed circulating cell-free DNA analysis.

## Project Overview

This pipeline integrates multiple data modalities to detect ultra-low frequency variants and predict MRD status:
- **90 Stage II/III CRC patients** with matched tumor/WBC exome data
- **50 healthy controls** for baseline establishment
- **Longitudinal plasma cfDNA samples** (t0-t4) with UMI barcoding
- **Multi-modal analysis**: variants, methylation, and fragmentomics

## Pipeline Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED & TESTED

**All 6 pipeline steps have been successfully implemented and tested:**
- ✅ Step 1: Tumor-Normal WES → Somatic Truth Set
- ✅ Step 2: Plasma cfDNA UMI-based WGS Processing  
- ✅ Step 2.5: Background Error Model from Healthy Donors
- ✅ Step 3: Feature Integration with Error-Aware Scoring
- ✅ Step 4: MRD Classification and Threshold Calibration
- ✅ Step 5: QC Gates & MultiQC
- ✅ Step 6: One-Click Reporting Dashboard

**The pipeline is production-ready and includes:**
- Complete Nextflow workflow implementation
- Docker containerization
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Automated quality control
- Clinical-grade reporting system

## Objectives

1. **Develop a statistically principled caller** for ultra-low VAF variants with context-aware error suppression and UMI consensus
2. **Classifier**: Integrate variant, methylation, and fragmentomics features into a single MRD probability with calibrated thresholds
3. **Validation**: Benchmark LoD, sensitivity/specificity, and longitudinal precision using spike-ins, reference standards, and retrospective cohorts
4. **Platform**: Ship a Nextflow + Docker pipeline running on AWS Batch/EC2/S3, with automated QC, audit-ready logs, and one-click reports
